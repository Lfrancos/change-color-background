## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ /

## Room for Improvement
Right now there is a problem with the code and I have't been able to figure out how to fix it.

> the problem is that after a couple of clicks the color of the background and the color of the text container are the same
> and that should not happen.

This means that I'm not fully understanding the way the code is being read, and need to ask for help so that I understand in a deep way why is this not working.
If I'm not able to understand this it could become a problem later on.

>Also I need to understand the comments a little bit better, I can say what the code is doing but I feel that I need to get better at explaining the thought process I have in order to create that code so that people actually understands as they go trough it.

The front-end is not beautiful this was an exercise to understand javascript and did not spend time on the design part.
